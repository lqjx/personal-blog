## About the project
This project is currently in it's early stages of development. For now you can read about the planned
features.

The quality of the code might be pretty fucking bad, and AV's will probably detect it, but I will
try really hard to make it as undetected as possible. I already got some plans and will experiment with it.

Also keep in mind that the tool is mainly for learning purposes. If I ever release the source code, <u>don't abuse
it</u>.
