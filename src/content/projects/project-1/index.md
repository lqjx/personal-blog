## About the project
Pretty much self-explanatory. This is no crazy work. I just wanted to try out this nice framework
and got this blog template and adjusted it to my liking.

I was about to code a blog website from scratch using Svelte, but I really wanted to try out something
new, so I decided to build it with Astro.
