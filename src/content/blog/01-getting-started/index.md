This is my personal blog. On this blog I will document my progress on various things that I love.
I really love malware and low-level coding in general.

I am not a tech bro. I am a low-skilled nerd tryna get cracked within the next 9 years.

Bookmark this super cool blog if you like reading interesting stories and want to learn new things.
