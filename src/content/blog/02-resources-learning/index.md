For my first post, I wanted to list and recommend some nice resources for learning about cryptography, malware, and reverse engineering.  They are a mixture of books and courses and websites.

## Reverse Engineering
Personally, I started reverse engineering by cracking simple CrackMe's and then increased the difficulty by cracking real-life applications. Then moved on to malware. These are some great resources to learn reverse engineering and cracking software:

**Courses:**

https://www.udemy.com/course/x64dbg-debugger/
https://www.udemy.com/course/reversing-software-protection/
https://www.udemy.com/course/x64dbg-static-analysis/

**Websites:**
https://crackmes.one/
https://om.malcore.io/
https://forum.tuts4you.com/
https://forum.exetools.com/index.php

**Books:**

https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/reversing-secrets-of/9780764574818/ (Pretty old book, but still recommended)

## Cryptography
I am currently in the process of learning about cryptography. To be honest, it is a quite difficult topic. Luckily, I found a really great book, which is a great introduction into cryptography. It is quite comprehensive, tightly packed with information and high-level enough to grasp the concepts of various ciphers. I highly recommend you to take your time studying this book and the topic in general:

**Websites:**

**Books:**

## Malware (Development)
Now to one of my, if not my favorite topic, I've ever discovered. Malware. I fucking love malware. From developing malware to reversing malware. It feels like black magic, capable of damaging software, to disrupting parts of nuclear reactors *(Go check out Stuxnet)*.

I have a shit ton of resources for it. I might not find everything right now, but I keep the resources in this blog post updated. Here are some resources I could find right now:

**Courses:**
